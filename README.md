# Applications of Transformers

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook exploring different applications of Transformer architectures.  
Transformers, introduced in the seminal paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* (Vaswani et al., 2017), have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and other domains by efficiently modeling sequential data and long-range dependencies through the self-attention mechanism.

## What’s Inside
- A short introduction to the Transformer architecture (encoder–decoder structure).
- Examples of Transformer applications in NLP tasks.
- Insights into how Transformers can be adapted for non-text data.

This notebook provides a concise overview — a short journey into the extraordinary capabilities of Transformers.
