        "Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\"  (2017) by Vaswani et al. They revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and other domains by enabling models to efficiently process sequential data, such as text, while capturing long-range dependencies and relationships between elements.</br>\n",
        "At their core, transformers rely on the self-attention mechanism , which allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence. This makes them highly scalable, parallelizable, and capable of handling complex tasks.</br>\n",
        "From a technical point of view the architecture of transformers has two main components: the encoder, able to convert plain text in rich contextualized embeddings and the decoder, with complementary capabilities. </br>\n",
        "This notebook will show different applications of transformers. A really short travel given their extraordinary capabilities, not only for language but for other kind of non structured data."

        "life_university = \"\"\" University is often the first time young adults experience true independence. Moving away from home means taking charge of daily responsibilities, from managing finances to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. While this newfound freedom is exhilarating, it also comes with its share of challenges. Balancing coursework, part-time jobs, and personal commitments requires discipline and adaptability.\n",
        "Living independently teaches valuable life skills that extend far beyond the classroom. Budgeting becomes crucial as students learn to stretch limited resources while prioritizing essentials. Cooking meals, doing laundry, and keeping living spaces tidy may seem mundane, but mastering these tasks instills a sense of accomplishment and self-reliance. Navigating bureaucratic processes like registering for classes, applying for scholarships, or resolving housing issues further sharpens organizational abilities.\n",
        "Emotional maturity is another key aspect of personal development during university. Being away from family support systems forces students to confront challenges head-on and develop resilience. Homesickness, stress, and uncertainty are common emotions that arise, but overcoming them builds inner strength and emotional intelligence. Counseling services and peer support networks offered by universities provide valuable assistance during tough times, reminding students that they are never alone.\n",
        "Self-discovery is perhaps the most profound outcome of university life. Removed from familiar surroundings, students have the freedom to explore who they are and who they want to become. They experiment with new hobbies, adopt fresh perspectives, and redefine their values. Some discover hidden talents; others find clarity about their career aspirations. This period of introspection lays the groundwork for future decisions and aspirations.\n",
        "Challenges and Coping Strategies\n",
        "Despite its many rewards, university life is not without its difficulties. Academic pressure, financial constraints, and mental health struggles are realities faced by countless students. Recognizing these challenges and adopting effective coping strategies is essential for thriving in this environment.\n",
        "Academic stress is perhaps the most pervasive issue. The sheer volume of material to cover, coupled with high expectations, can overwhelm even the most diligent students. To combat this, time management techniques such as creating schedules, setting priorities, and breaking tasks into manageable chunks prove invaluable. Seeking help from professors, teaching assistants, or tutoring centers is also encouraged, as these resources are designed to support student success.\n",
        "Financial burdens pose another significant hurdle. Tuition fees, accommodation costs, textbooks, and other expenses can strain budgets, especially for those relying on loans or part-time jobs. Scholarships, grants, and budgeting apps offer practical solutions, while frugal living habits—like cooking at home or opting for second-hand textbooks—can ease monetary pressures. Universities often provide financial literacy workshops and emergency funds to assist students in need.\n",
        "Mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, and burnout, are increasingly prevalent among university students. The stigma surrounding mental health has diminished in recent years, thanks to awareness campaigns and advocacy efforts. Counseling centers, mindfulness workshops, and peer support groups create safe spaces for addressing emotional struggles. Practicing self-care through exercise, meditation, or creative outlets also contributes to overall well-being.\n",
        "Balancing academics with social and personal commitments presents yet another challenge. Overcommitting to extracurricular activities or neglecting rest can lead to burnout. Setting boundaries, saying no when necessary, and scheduling downtime are crucial for maintaining equilibrium. Learning to prioritize what truly matters helps students stay focused and fulfilled.\n",
        "Lifelong Lessons and Future Prospects\n",
        "The lessons learned during university transcend academic knowledge. Time management, adaptability, and resilience are just a few examples of skills that prepare students for life beyond graduation. These competencies empower graduates to navigate the complexities of the modern workforce, pursue advanced studies, or embark on entrepreneurial ventures.\n",
        "Networking plays a vital role in shaping future prospects. Connections made during university—whether with professors, alumni, or fellow students—can open doors to internships, job opportunities, and mentorship programs. Career fairs, industry panels, and alumni events facilitate these interactions, enabling students to build professional relationships that last a lifetime.\n",
        "Perhaps the greatest legacy of university life is the sense of possibility it instills. Graduates leave equipped not only with diplomas but also with confidence, vision, and a hunger for continuous learning. Whether pursuing careers in medicine, engineering, arts, or business, they carry forward the spirit of inquiry and innovation nurtured during their university years.\n",
        "In conclusion, life in university is a multifaceted experience that encompasses academics, social dynamics, independence, and personal growth. It is a crucible where challenges are met with determination, friendships are forged, and dreams take flight. Though fraught with obstacles, this journey equips individuals with the tools and mindset needed to thrive in an ever-evolving world. As students graduate and move on to the next phase of their lives, they carry with them the indelible imprint of their university experience—a testament to the power of education to transform lives. \"\"\"\n"
